# No Index Page Story

Use this file to capture decisions we still need to make for the Non-Index page story. Fill in the prompts below and hand the answers back to AI for implementation.

- When each header button is clicked (logo, search, hamburger, utility, breadcrumb home), should it navigate, open a modal, or trigger analytics? _Answer:_
- When form controls are clicked (state select, bedroom pills, home type tiles, timeline checkboxes, primary CTA), what backend or analytics events should fire? _Answer:_
- Hover and focus styling: do the hero buttons, pills, tiles, and CTA keep the current subtle lift and accent colors, or should they change elevation/tones? _Answer:_
- Scroll behavior: should the hero/header remain static, shrink into a sticky bar, or fade once the card scrolls into view? _Answer:_
- Form submission: what is the success path (navigation, API call, inline results), and how should validation errors appear? _Answer:_
